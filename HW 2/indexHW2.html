            <h3>I like playing piano</h3>
            <p>Many years ago I studied music and loved to play the piano. My favorite composers were Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Mozart and others. Now I would like to resume my hobby again. Currently, there is already a new generation of pianos - digital pianos. Equipped with a GrandFeel Compact wooden keyboard with triple touch technology, Ivory Touch surface and simulated pressure points, it provides perfect control and maximum repetition.</p>

            <h3>My future job</h3>
            <p>After many years of working in finance, I decided to change my life and master a new promising profession as a Web developer. In this regard, I am currently studying at the Tel-Ran IT school. The IT school teachers introduce me to the intricacies of this profession and share their experience in this field.
                Thanks to efforts on both sides, I am confidently moving towards my dream.

        <h3>Family is important</h3>
        <p>Family is important because it offers emotional support, nurtures a feeling of belonging, encourages educational growth, and fosters cognitive development. A family meets diverse needs throughout the various phases of life, from infancy through old age.
           Families serve crucial societal functions, including socialization, values transmission, and social stability. Families can influence a childâ€™s brain development, prospects of success in life, the formation of future relationships, health, and overall life satisfaction.
